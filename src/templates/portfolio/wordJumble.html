        <strong>Emerson I/O on Demand</strong> is an online marketing site/app that advertises the cost benefits of the
        company's electronic marshalling systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        The app is a true thick client in that nearly all the code, with the exception of a small PHP mailing script,
        exists client side. It was built with the BackboneJS MVC framework, and uses
        the associated router component to deep link between "pages".

    <p>
        For the "Calculate Savings" page, the algorithms used had to (rather painstackingly) be extracted
        from Excel spreadsheets into javascript (it was deemed Ok to keep this logic client side as the algorithms
        themselves were not proprietary). The graphs on that page
        are dynamically drawn with the RaphelJS vector library, which offered enough flexibility to keep with the
        original designs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite its responsive nature, the entire site is backwards compatible all the way to IE8.
