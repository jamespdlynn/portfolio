        <strong>512 Games LLC.</strong> is a company I founded in May 2020, dedicated to the creation of social, online mobile games.</p>

        <p>The company's feature product is the <strong>Play Pals</strong> character-builder meta game. When a user first creates their 512 Games account, they choose
            between one of six customizable avatars to represent themselves while they play. As they progress through a game, a player will gain experience, coins and gems, which they can use to unlock new items of clothing for their avatar.

        <p>The Play Pals meta game code is designed so it can be integrated into just about any type of casual mobile game, with players able to share their account and "Play Pal" between games.</p>

        <p>All of the company's games are intended to be free to play, with monetization coming through in app purchases and/or rewarded advertisements.</p>
