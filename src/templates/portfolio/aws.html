        Atypical of the industry, I design my games to be relatively server authoritative, meaning the server does not simply act as a data relay,
        but is also responsible for executing a large portion of each game's business logic. To do this effeciently, I manage the entirety of own custom server stack within an <b>AWS Virtual Private Cloud</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Server authoritative applications have a number of advantages over ones where nearly all the code exists on the client:
        <ul>
          <li>As all the server code runs on the same Linux operating systems, there's less likelihood of encountering platform specific bugs.</li>
          <li>Having validation reside on the server makes it much more difficult for players to cheat or fake purchases.</li>
          <li>Server code is (generally) easier to write integration tests for.</li>
          <li>Server code changes can be deployed to production almost instantaneously, while it can take over a week to roll out a new version of a client to all the app stores.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>I designed my AWS stack with a focus on low-latency and high-throughput, while keeping overall costs to a minimum.</p>

    <p>
        The server code is written in <strong>NodeJS</strong> and deployed using <strong>Elastic Beanstalk</strong>. All incoming client API requests are load balanced between 2-8 EC2 service instances (instances are auto scaled based on current average latency and CPU utilisation).
        API Requests, along with being SSL encrypted, require multiple types of custom authentication header token to ensure the security of each user's account and data.
    </p>

    <p>
        The primary database is a MongoDB NoSQL cluster managed by <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong> (though still hosted within the same AWS VPC as the rest of the stack).
        Two <strong>Elastic Cache Redis</strong> replica instances help reduce primary database load, by functioning as a temporary shared in-memory cache.
    </p>

    <p>
        A private <strong>S3 bucket</strong> is used to store a game's remote Unity Asset Bundles (compressed batches of binary assets like textures and audio files). These are automatically propagated to <strong>CloudFront</strong>'s global distribution network nodes, to be downloaded by their associated client devices.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every client request, whether handled by Cloudfront or the EC2 instances, has its pertinent information logged to <strong>CloudWatch</strong> for analytics and debugging. Logs are retained for up to 14 days.
