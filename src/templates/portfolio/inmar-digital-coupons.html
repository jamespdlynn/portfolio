    <p>
        <strong>Inmar Digital Coupons</strong> consists of a standalone RESTful API used for finding, clipping and
        managing digital coupons; as well
        as a responsive web application that utilizes said API. The client app is currently in production through dozens
        of retailers nationwide.

    <p>
        The API middleware was developed to mitigate the slowness and hassle of retrieving coupon data from Inmar's
        legacy DNP servers.
        The middleware is built using NodeJS and the restify module. A nightly process on the server downloads retailer
        specific Digital Coupon data en bulk, and parses
        it into a local NoSQL Mongo database. API GET requests from the client then query directly against this data
        cache, while POST requests (a.k.a coupon clip calls) function simply as pass throughs to the DPN.
    </p>

    <p>
        The client application is built using the Backbone Marionette MVC framework coupled with RequireJS and
        Bootstrap. It consists of a homepage used to search for and clip coupons,
        a "wallet" used to view and check off the coupons you've clipped, and a "savings" page that details your
        spending habits. All communication between the client and server is asynchronous.
