        <strong>Hyper Galactic</strong> is a real-time 2D space shooter MMO that supports hundreds of simultaneous users
        and is playable directly in modern browsers.
        The game originally began as a tech demo for a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/microjs" target="_blank">binary
        protocol buffer</a> javascript library I wrote, but
        proved interesting enough that I gradually evolved it into a standalone entity.

        The game's HTML 5 client communicates with the Node.js server through low level binary web sockets. A major
        benefit to using Node.js here, aside from
        its inherent advantages for bidirectional data transfer, is by utilizing AMD modules I can share reuse the same
        javascript code on the client and server. This allows for certain logic,
        such as the physics engine, to be leveraged by both ends, removing the need for duplicate code or overly chatty
        positioning communication.

        Apart from the <a href="http://www.createjs.com/" target="_blank">createjs suite</a>, which I leveraged to help
        with some of the more common HTML5 gaming elements, the entire game was
        built from a relatively low level with few third party libraries. This allowed me both more fine-grained control
        and to better understand some core concepts of real time gaming,
        such as dead reckoning and zonal collision detection.
